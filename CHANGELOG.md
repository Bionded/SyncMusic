# Changelog

All notable changes to SyncMusic are listed here. The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/),
versions follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [0.2.0]

The first public release.

### Added
- **Libraries**: Navidrome (Subsonic API), a plain folder of audio files, Audiobookshelf (audiobooks and podcasts),
  Jellyfin (movies and episodes, one way to the player; beta).
- **Devices**: iPods with Apple's firmware (via pygpod; tested on the iPod Classic), Rockbox players, USB flash
  drives (vfat, exFAT, ext4, NTFS), a folder on an FTP or SMB server, and **HiBy R1** (SonixOS) players.
- **Rules and templates**: what goes onto a device, compatible with Navidrome smart playlists (`.nsp`), written in
  JSON/YAML or built in the UI, shared between devices as templates; default templates per library.
- **Processors** per device: transcode (FLAC → ALAC/AAC/MP3 …), retag, covers, lyrics (`.lrc`).
- **Reverse sync**: play counts, ratings, favourites and podcast/audiobook positions go back to Navidrome and
  Audiobookshelf.
- Web UI that also works on a phone, optional desktop window, REST API and command line client.
- Packaging: single-file binaries for Linux x86_64 and arm64 (`--install` as a systemd service), a Docker image,
  install from source.

### Known limitations
- **No authentication:** run SyncMusic only on a trusted local network.
- **Fresh installs only:** there are no database migrations yet; a later version may require starting over. A
  database SyncMusic does not know is refused at start with a message (delete it, or restore a backup).
- iPod nano 6G/7G are refused (their database checksum cannot be written).
- Linux only (x86_64, arm64 incl. Raspberry Pi; glibc ≥ 2.28). No Windows, macOS or Android/MTP yet.
